            The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/wasmsf/">WebAssembly SF</a> Meetup group meets once a month, to bring together developers who are passionate about WebAssembly or "wasm". Each month the meeting is hosted at the offices of a different tech company in San Francisco, and one or two members of the group give a presentation about something they have accomplished or learned using WebAssembly either in their jobs or side projects. There is ample time before and after the talks for food, drinks, and socializing.
            
            The first talk of the night was given by <a href="https://twitter.com/torch2424">Aaron Turner</a>, a JavaScript Developer at Google, about his Gameboy Color Emulator side projects written in WebAssembly Script, called WasmBoy and VaporBoy. I went into the talk with some familiarity with ROMs and Emulators, but not the challenges presented in trying to make an emulator which would run within a web browser.

            The second talk of the evening was given by two Web Developers from <a href="https://nearprotocol.com/"> Near Protocol</a> about how their startup was using WebAssembly for BlockChain. In a WebAssembly SF first, this presentation included a live demo, inspired by the first talk of the night, the presenters coded a simple Pokedex which could send Pokemon JSONs via BlockChain as a way to demonstrate what can be done using Near's IDE. Having had not previous exposure to WebAssembly nor blockchain, I found this presentation to be very informative.
