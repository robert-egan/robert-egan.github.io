                <p>
                    The Jelly Donut is a family run operation located in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District. In business since 1988, the store front is now being ran by the second generation of confectioners. Their dedication to their craft and their clientele is well known, and demonstrated by the infrequency in which the shop is closed, usually 3 to 4 days of the year.

                    Their reputation for including complimentary donut holes with every purchase has made them well known among pastry lovers, and well loved around the neighborhood. Given that their area is undergoing a rushed and rocky gentrification, it is a surprise that this conventional pastry shop has been able to thrive in spite of the artisenal branded competitors continually opening up along 24th St.
