    The first thing I needed to do was go through and properly indent all of the existing elements in the page, while doing so I was also able to identify all of the elements which were missspelled or missing the apropriate closing tags. 

    Then I added the <DOCTYPE> tag, the lang attribute to the <html> tag, the two <meta> tags for charset and description, and the <style> tag where I relocated the CSS for the <h1> element and gave it some color. In the body I added the alt attribute to the oldboat.gif <img> tag, and added the <ul> and </ul> tags to fix the unordered list.

    Next I added the two links called for in the assignment, the first to the W3 Schools as a resource for html coding, and the second to the CCSF student counseling page.

            In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.

            <img style="float:left;" src="oldboat.gif" alt="An old boat, resembling a Viking ship">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!

            You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.

            For information regarding HTML5 and CSS, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The W3 Schools</a> is a fantastic resource!

            City College of San Franciso offers a number of resources to assist and support its students, one such being <a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#wrap-subcontent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Counseling</a>.

            <h2>
                Subtitle of our page
            </h2>
            <p>
                It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
                We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
                and that's the idea of this exercise!
            </p>
        
            <p>
                At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!

                Steps to being a smart web developer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Planning out a web page before coding
                </li>
                <li>
                    Studying the target audience
                </li>
                <li>
                    Following up to date standards
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Being responsive and accessible</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!
